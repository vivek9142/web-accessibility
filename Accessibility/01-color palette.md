# Designing an accessible color palette

Accessibility starts with design. And this is often where accessibility problems and conflicts start appearing as well. Designing an accessible color palette for your project centers on two core principles, ensure there is sufficient color contrast between text and background and between elements that are supposed to contrast one another, and ensure you account for colorblindness in any designs where colors are meant to communicate something. 

***Contrast, the WCAG or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines level AA recommends – ***
Background to text color contrast ratios:

*	Small Text (23px or less ) : 4.5
*	Small bold text (17px or less) : 4.5
*	Large Text (24px or more):3

These contrast numbers are fairly high and they get higher the thinner your font gets.

For This you can use Tools like –
*	Webaim Contrast Checker [https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/]
*	Adobe Color [https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer]

***Guides***

*	User interfaces often use red and green to distinguish between “on” and “off” states.-
    Any time you use color to indicate state, you should also use words. As an example, if you have a toggle indicating on off state then also add the words on off to ensure that even if the colors are not seen, or they're not communicating properly, the status is still accessible.

*	Don’t rely on color difference only when including state.
