Adding transcripts 
If a webpage contains an audio or video file with information, it should also contain a full transcript. transcripts make the information available to anyone able to access text, transcripts make the information searchable, copyable and to a degree translatable and transcripts make the information indexable on search engines. 
This brings up two immediate questions. How do I create a transcript? And how do I add it to a page without the transcript taking up the entire page? Both of these questions become more pressing the longer and more expansive the media is. 
The proper answer to the first question is every video and audio files should have a transcript written by a professional service and a human being. That sounds expensive but it's getting cheaper by the day. And more and more services are using some form of hybrid model with voice recognition software and then human editors at the end. Transcription is a cost of doing business and it's well worth the money for all the reasons I listed before. 
If you don't have the resources or time to get a professional transcription done there are services that use voice recognition to generate automatic transcriptions. They are let's call it okay.
You need to add it to your page as texts. So it becomes searchable, indexable and part of the page. In some cases, posting the transcript in full on the page makes sense, in others it may be necessary to partially hide it from the viewer or place it somewhere where they can independently scroll it. This is especially true if the transcript is very long and accompanies an article or other information, the visitor should have access to which honestly is in most cases I've set up two different examples on how you can try to solve this problems.
And the first example, we just placed the transcript in a separate box that has a fixed height and set the overflow to auto, that way we get a scrollable box that can be placed anywhere on the page. Usually next to the video that is independent of the rest of the contents, we can scroll the content on the page and the transcript independently. And yet everything is indexed by search engines.

The second option is a bit more advanced. Here we use some JavaScript and CSS to hide or show the transcript. So when you load this page, you get the video then you get the transcript but the transcript is sort of faded at the bottom. And then when you click expand transcript to get the entire transcript. This is a fairly straightforward process. It's powered by some basic Java script.
