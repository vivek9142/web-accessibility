# Elements with purposeLink and button basics

In addition to structural semantic elements, HTML has a laundry list of elements fit for specific purposes - 

*	<nav> is for navigation
*	<table> is for tables
*	<form> is for forms
*	<ul> and <ol> are for unordered and ordered lists
*	<select> is for selecting things
*	<input> is for inputting things
*	<button> is for buttons
*	<a> is for links.

The trick here is to always employ that accessibility mindset. Anytime you want to do something, first identify the purpose of the thing you are developing and see if there is an existing HTML element that already serves that purpose. If there is, use that element and extend its functionality where necessary instead of building a whole new feature from scratch. That way you get all the accessibility benefits and need to write much less code in the process.
